    <string name="article_body">Hamburg is a city of superlatives: the biggest, the most, the oldest.
        It has the biggest and busiest harbor in Germany, most of Germany\'s major media, the oldest stock exchange in Germany, more bridges than Venice -- and even the world\'s largest fitness studio.
        Hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in Germany. But the people who live there think it\â€™s worth it, as do the thousands who visit each year.
        Germany\'s second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries. It is located at the confluence of the Alster and Elbe rivers, and has a direct link to the North Sea some 100 kilometers (62 miles) downstream.
        It\'s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century, making Hamburg Germany\'s most important port.
        The harbor dominates the cityscape.
        Though by no means pretty in the traditional sense, it\'s certainly worth a visit, if only to appreciate its size and scale.</string>
